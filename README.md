# Game Picker

## Description

This is a simple project that I decided to do to practice JavaScript syntax.
It has most of the video games from my library, and it generates random messages picking the genre, the game in that genre, 
and the play time for you every time you run it.

## How to run

1. First, you need [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer.
2. Once installed, open a terminal window and type `node "FILEPATH"`, replacing FILEPATH with the path to the **main.js** file.
